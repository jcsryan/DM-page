                <p>I have been playing dungeons and dragons since I was in highschool. For nearly two decades I have walked the worlds
                    of Faerun and Greyhawk, I have played nearly every class for many dungeon masters. Seven years ago I moved and
                    couldn't find a game, so I made one and I fell in love with the other side of D&D. Being a dungeon master is my
                    favorite job, I have the opportunity to bring you, my players, into a fantastical world born out of my imagination. I 
                    get set a scene and a story and you get to provide the agency, it is communal storytelling in its purest form. I
                    invite anyone with even a passing curiosity about dungeons and dragons to give it a try, and hopefully, you will
                    love it as much as I do.
