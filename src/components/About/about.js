                <p>
    Dungeons and Dragons is a hobby in its golden age. There has never been a better time to gather with your friends and lose yourself
    in an adventure in the worlds of Faerun, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and countless others. If you have never played it might just look like
    a group of people sitting around a table yelling and throwing dice at one another but it is so much more. Your campaign, your story, is a
    living thing that you craft together with your dungeon master and your friends. The world lives and breathes and changes in grand and subtle
    ways around you based on how you decide to interact with it and its many peoples. Battles rage and empires rise and fall and your party tips
    the scales of these conflicts. Mad necromancers enslave towns and use the inhabitants as test subjects in twisted arcane experiments, and 
    you and your friends are their only hope. Legions of dark abominations flood out of the deep caves of the world, intent on the destruction 
    and enslavement of those who live on the surface, and you have been hired to stem the tide.
